The File System Module:
    - fs module, exports functions for working with files and directories
    - file 1_fs.js show example of reading file.txt, if it doesn't exist than showing error.

The HTTP Module:
    - it provides functionality for running HTTP servers and making HTTP requests.
    - file 2_server.js show example of HTTP server.

Streams:
    - we have Writable and Readable streams.
For example, for creating HTTP server used the respose object and request object it is example of writable streams.
But also it's objects of readable streams.
Readable streams have "data" and "end" events. The first is fired every time data comes in,
and the second is called whenever the stream is at its end. This model is most suited for streaming
data that can be immediately processed, even when the whole document isn't available yet. A file
can be read as a readable stream by using the createReadStream function from fs.
    - file 2_server.js show example of HTTP server using streams functions, read text from file example.txt and showing it on webpage.
